# 2. Current analysis

## 2.1 Introduction to data set

The data set `2024-03-04-WIF-tis4d.xlsx` is stored in the folder `raw-data`. It contains following terms:

1.  `cell_line`: The two cell line types used for the experiment, Wild-type and Cell-type 101, character.

2.  `Treatment`: This variable describes whether to add new treatment. Added: Activating factor 42; Not added: Placebo (saline added instead), character.

3.  `name`: Names of different cell lines. There are two cell lines for each identical cell line type and the same treatment. There were 8 cell lines in total, character.

4.  `conc`: Different concentration of a growth factor, from $0$ to $10$, numeric.

5.  `gene_expression`: Gene expression level, numeric.

## 2.2 EDA (2024-3-21)

Karl requested an EDA on this data set and a presentation be prepared to explain the results to his boss. The complete code for performing EDA on the data is located in the `R-code` folder, named `2024-03-21-EDA.Rmd`. The slides are located in the `slide` folder, named `2024-03-21-EDA.pptx`.

## 2.3 Reproducing an EDA figure (2024-04-01)

Karl requested to plot the following figure and save as an .tiff file (9in x 6in) with a resolution of 500, and use Time New Roman font.

![Gene figure](figs/genefig.png)

This is a gene expression vs. growth factor concentrations plot. The plot is divided into two parts based on cell line type, labelled as A and B, and different colors are used to represent different treatments. The tags on the graph represent different cell line individuals.

The complete code for this is located in the `R-code` folder, named `2024-04-01-Figure.Rmd`. The figure was saved in the `figs` folder, named `gene_fig.tiff`.

## 2.4 Calculate sample size for grant (2024-05-22)

Karl requested to calculate sample size for a grant application. They were going to do a linear regression of gene expression with five predictors: concentration, cell age, treatment (two levels), cell type (two levels), and media (two levels). They have done a previous study and got an $R^2$ of 0.1 between the predictors and the response level. They wanted a power of $90\%$ and a significance level of $0.05$.

The calculation shows that they need a total of $154$ samples.

The complete code for this sample size calculation is located in the `R-code` folder, named `2024-05-22-sample size.Rmd`. For better understanding, we have also generated a report named `2024-05-22-sample-size.pdf`, located in the `report` folder.

## 2.5 Fit predictive models (2024-05-28)

The final step of the current analysis is to fit a predictive model to the gene expression data.

As mentioned earlier, the purpose of this project is to explore the impact of different treatments on the promotion effect of growth factors on gene expression. Among the five variables, gene expression is the response variable, while the other four are independent variables, consisting of three categorical variables and one numerical variable.

From the previous EDA, differences in gene expression across various levels of cell line type and treatment were observed. Generally, gene expression tends to increase with higher concentrations of growth factors. As depicted in the gene figure shown below, even with identical treatment and growth factor concentrations, disparities in gene expression persist among different individuals of the same cell line type. Consequently, it can be considered to include the variable `name` as either an independent variable or a random effect (since in future predictions, we might encounter new cell line individuals, so fitting parameters only for the current eight cell line individuals would be unreasonable).

![Gene figure](figs/genefig.png)

Therefore, two models were considered: a linear model and a linear mixed-effects model. In the linear model, `name` is treated as a regular categorical variable. In the mixed-effects model, `name` is treated as a random effect. Additionally, since the study aims to investigate the effect of treatment on the relationship between growth factor and gene expression, we also tested the necessity of adding the interaction term between `Treatment` and `conc` in both the linear model and the linear mixed-effects model. The results indicate that adding this interaction term is crucial for both models. So the following two models were compared:

1.  Linear model:

    gene_expression \~ Treatment \* conc + cell_line + name

2.  Linear mixed-effects model (1\|name indicates that `name` is a random factor):

    gene_expression \~ Treatment \* conc + cell_line + (1\|name)

Subsequently, the two models were compared using AIC, BIC, and regression diagnostic plots. The comparison results indicated that the linear model slightly outperformed the linear mixed-effects model. However, the difference between the two models was very small. Considering that new cell line individuals will be encountered in future predictions using the model, `name` should still be treated as a random effect. Therefore, the final model chosen is a linear mixed-effects model with `gene_expression` as the response variable, `Treatment`, `conc`, and `cell_line` as fixed effects, `name` as a random effect, and an interaction term between `Treatment` and `conc`.

The complete model fitting process code can be found in the `R-code` folder in the `2024-05-28-Fit models.Rmd` file. For a more detailed model analysis process, please refer to the `2024-05-29-IMRaD-Report.pdf` file in the `report` folder.

## 2.6 IMRaD report (2024-05-29)

Finally, Karl requested an IMRaD report that encompasses all the key points from the analysis process described above. This report serves as a summary of the previous work but does not include all the code. The R code to generate this IMRaD report can be found in the `R-code` folder, named `2024-05-29-IMRaD-Report.Rmd`. The corresponding PDF report is in the `report` folder, named `2024-05-29-IMRaD-Report.pdf`.
